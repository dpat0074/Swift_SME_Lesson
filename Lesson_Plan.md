# Swift: Brief Introduction

### Purpose (5 Mins)
The purpose of the introduction is to let the learners be aware that there is a new native ios coding language called swift that is used to not only create apps for mobile devices but also for macOS, watchOS, tvOS app. Many parts of swift are similar to Objective-C, but is easier to read and also contains all the basic data types. The most recent version of Swift currently is 5.0

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the day learners will be able to:
1. Know how to create variables and constants
1. Know how to use simple data types
1. Know how to use arrays and loops
1. Know how to use IDE XCode
1. Know the process in how to create a 'Hello World' App


### Setup (5 Mins)
The purpose here to to make sure everyone has XCode or a version of it running on their machines. Emphasize that XCode is not supported on Windows based machines and is strictly for those that own machines that run a MacOS operating system.

Have users do the following before diving into the code to make sure they are all setup to play around with the code as they feel comfortable afterwards.
1. Open XCode
1. Click on ```Get started with playground```
1. Click on ```Blank``` under the iOS tab and click ```next```
1. Give the playground a name like you would any file and select where to store it on your machine before clicking ```Create```

Now that users have a blank playground to work with and experiment code with, show them that the boilderplate code or any code you put into the editor can be ran line by line and the results will display on the right hand side console.

Everyone should see something like this.. [Insert Screenshot Link Here](www.google.com).
